# React Pride App 🏳️‍🌈 🏳️‍⚧️

This application was built to practice **State Lifting in React**. That means passing the state via _props_ from one component to another, particularly from **child** to **parent** component.

## Why the Pride theme?

That part wasn't planned. I used it because it made sense considering the purpose of the application and also because equality is one of the most important social issues of our time. If you still haven't opened your heart to this cause and feel somehow offended by Pride related aesthetics, I apologize. Try to view this experience as a personal growing opportunity! 🌈 🌈 🌈

## How it works

-   It has three components: A body, a header and the buttons
-   The initial look uses the Transgender Flag colors
-   Clicking the first button changes the body's background color, and the second changes the header's
-   The colors are selected randomly from the 8 colors of both flags

## To run this application

-   `npm install`
-   `npm start`

And that's it. Enjoy!
